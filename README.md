# multi-geth's RFC Process

This repository documents things potentially controversial, but may need to apply in the `multi-geth` project. Those includes hard forks, new network additions or protocol changes.

Usually we accept all networks unless it requires a great amount of work. However, we may ask you to enable hard forks or new networks under different configuration flags.

## Request for Justifications

For networks wanting to apply specifications that requires scrutiny, the process of **Request for Justifications** (RFJs) may be required. The overall goal of RFJs is to reduce the chance of MultiGeth and OpenEthereum (and possibly other clients) to be accused of implementing a specification, if it contains flaws. However, note that this process also does not mean MultiGeth provides any warranty.

This independent review process will require developers wishing to have the changes adopted to write down explanations and justifications for a few review questions. If a review is left unanswered, left with insufficient anwers, or being refused to answer, the release notes of `multi-geth` will propoerly document those RFJs.
