# multi-geth's RFC Process

This repository documents things potentially controversial, but may need to apply in the `multi-geth` project. Those includes hard forks, new network additions or protocol changes.

Usually we accept all networks unless it requires a great amount of work. However, we may ask you to enable hard forks or new networks under different configuration flags.
